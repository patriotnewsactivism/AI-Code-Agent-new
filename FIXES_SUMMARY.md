# AI Code Agent - Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes and improvements made to the AI Code Agent application. The main issues identified and resolved include:

1. Critical security issue with API key exposure
2. Implementation of a secure backend proxy
3. Improved documentation for deployment

## Detailed Fixes

### 1. Fixed Critical Security Issue: API Key Exposure
- **Issue**: The Google Gemini API key was being exposed directly in client-side JavaScript
- **Fix**: Created a backend proxy server to handle API requests securely
- **Impact**: API key is now secure and not exposed to clients

### 2. Implemented Backend Proxy Server
- **Issue**: No secure way to handle API requests
- **Fix**: Created `server.js` with Express server implementation
- **Impact**: All API requests are now handled server-side

### 3. Improved Environment Configuration
- **Issue**: API key management was insecure
- **Fix**: Added `.env` file template and proper environment variable support
- **Impact**: Secure storage of sensitive data

### 4. Enhanced Documentation
- **Issue**: Missing clear instructions for secure deployment
- **Fix**: Created `BACKEND_SETUP.md` with detailed setup instructions
- **Impact**: Users can now easily deploy the application securely

## Technical Details

### Secure API Integration
The application now properly integrates with the Gemini API through a secure backend proxy:
- Backend endpoint: `/api/generate`
- Secure Google API endpoint: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent`
- Environment variable support for API key: `process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- Proper error handling for API requests

### Backend Proxy Implementation
- Created `server.js` with Express framework
- Added `dotenv` for environment variable management
- Implemented secure communication with Google's API
- Added proper error handling and response parsing

### Deployment Configuration
- Updated `package.json` with new start script
- Created `.env` template for API key configuration
- Verified `.gitignore` includes `.env` to prevent exposure
- Added comprehensive setup documentation

## Security Benefits

- API key is never exposed in client-side code
- All API requests are handled server-side
- Environment variables keep sensitive data secure
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

## Deployment Instructions

1. Get a Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Add the key to the `.env` file
3. Install backend dependencies: `npm install express node-fetch dotenv`
4. Build the frontend: `npm run build`
5. Start the server: `npm start`
6. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Conclusion
The AI Code Agent application is now secure and ready for deployment. The critical security vulnerability of API key exposure has been resolved by implementing a backend proxy server. All API requests are now handled server-side, keeping the API key secure while maintaining full functionality of the application.
